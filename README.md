# Comixology theme for Ubooquity

A Comixology-based theme for Ubooquity.

Support thread [here](https://ubooquity.userecho.com/communities/1/topics/756-comixology-theme-v2-finally-released).

Releases page for proper version updates, or download the folder from the repo for in-development features.

**You need to use a zipped release (from the releases page) for your first install, as it contains a settings.js file not included in the repo.**

#### Known Issues:

- The web reader for comics and PDFs needs a page count, and since I don't have access to metadata I've hardcoded this to 1000. This doesn't hinder functionality, so fixing it isn't a pressing concern.
