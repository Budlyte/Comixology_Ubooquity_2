# Comixology theme for Ubooquity

A Comixology-based theme for Ubooquity.

Support thread [here](https://ubooquity.userecho.com/communities/1/topics/756-comixology-theme-v2-finally-released).

Releases page for proper version updates, or download the folder from the repo for in-development features.

**You need to use a zipped release (comixology2.zip from the releases page, not a source code zip) for your first install, as it contains a settings.js file not included in the repo.**

This is my more mobile friendly version, with a few custom tweaks such as allowing more lines in the comic name and swapping its place with the issue number.
